anything but
square peg in a round hole
hit or miss
silver lining
in the air
make light of
through thick and thin
in no time
throw down the gauntlet
way forward
on edge
a smooth sea never made a skilled sailor
drain the swamp
ride high
at odds
under siege
have no business
take heart
rake over the coals
stand in a good stead
smack dab
get a life
throw under the bus
cold sweat
on the horizon
wild goose chase
kick the can down the road
pat on the back
heart touching
tick off
mull over
right away
turn out
for a while
bring up
come out
turn over a new leaf
get through
vim and vigor
buy the farm
a fish out of water
bucket list
on the tip of my tongue
from the bottom of my heart
light years away
you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink
lion's share
knock out
mad at
screw up
aftermath
white lie
take for a ride
get to know
green with envy
pep talk
like a bat out of hell
trouble shared is trouble halved
all roads lead to rome
knock socks off
apples to oranges
seventh heaven
heavy heart
lighten up
crack up
troubled waters
live wire
long run
black friday
get the wrong end of the stick
get on nerves
mind your own business
good grief
the lion's den
miles away
make a mountain out of a molehill
dead as a doornail
dead in the water
rule out
as a result
spend a fortune
black day
fake it till you make it
six of one, half a dozen of the other
out of business
against the grain
music to ears
apples to apples
by chance
take for granted
mind your own beeswax
walking on air
lean towards
chill pill
bundle up
set off
catch up
you're on
put the brakes on
easy does it
mark my words
pie in the sky
easter egg
out of the frying pan into the fire
act of god
toot one's own horn
fast food
on a roll
ward off
drop by
broken heart
blind as a bat
in a fog
dollars to donuts
fair-weather friend
under fire
first light
once bitten, twice shy
kick the habit
make ends meet
head above water
up and about
free spirit
keep the wolf from the door
so to speak
stands to reason
up to no good
zip it
in vain
sleep tight
on your mark
too close to call
the devil is beating his wife
when hell freezes over
all that glitters is not gold
forty winks
elvis has left the building
famous last words
sense of humour
a stitch in time saves nine
other half
for a song
not at all
beat the heat
make do
leg it
snow under
last long
next of kin
fall from grace
go with the flow
neck and neck
under the radar
get goat
piece of writing
speak soon
piece of work
stand out
road to recovery
slip of the tongue
over and above
over and over again
over and out
prone to
get off
on the mend
look forward
like a hole in the head
snow job
in the nick of time
bump into
i could eat a horse
low hanging fruit
double take
the devil is in the detail
shifting sands
so and so
so so
all the rage
earworm
lose it
lost on
lost to
take over
mr right, ms right
meet halfway
ups and downs
take care
larger than life
take on
in stitches
red herring
knight in shining armour
pot calling the kettle black
heart and soul
miles to go before i sleep
fat chance
point out
take it on the chin
you can't teach an old dog new tricks
the best is yet to come
give a shot
take turns
high roller
cut the crap
wind up
up to the mark
hang up
in a row
and so on
figure of speech
black hole
see the light
spanner in the works
of course
warm-hearted
hold tongue
catnap
pardon me
sea change
figure out
eat crow
on a silver platter
fit of anger
zip past
zero-sum game
a voice crying in the wilderness
at the drop of a dime
time after time
roll the dice
sitting duck
throw the baby out with the bathwater
skating on thin ice
playing second fiddle
mend fences
cry me a river
eat words
time will tell
on the other hand
silence is golden
paint the town red
end of the day
fall out
in touch
eager beaver
come over
run out
count on
a sight for sore eyes
weak in the knees
never mind
say what
point blank
cheat sheet
in a huff
give up
all the best
pain in the neck
learning curve
as simple as that
take stock
all day long
carry on
slow day
head start
speak up
break open
hang on
what are you up to
at the same time
none of your business
high up
all set
pass away
stay up
go after
drive crazy
speak too soon
a burnt child dreads the fire
blowing smoke
heart goes out to
high time
treasure trove
finishing touch
necessary evil
shades of grey
as different as chalk and cheese
means to an end
line in the sand
full of beans
from pillar to post
shed light
laughter is the best medicine
butter up
buck up
stiff upper lip
wet behind the ears
kill the goose that lays the golden egg
in a nutshell
keep your nose clean
cat got your tongue
from now on
head-on
bite the bullet
in a pickle
walk on eggshell
bun in the oven
tight-lipped
apple polisher
a lot on my plate
far-fetched
bring home the bacon
chill to the marrow
running around like a headless chicken
beck and call
at sixes and sevens
the eleventh hour
bon appetit
back against the wall
button your lip
break the mould
that's the way the cookie crumbles
feel the pinch
keep your hair on
take a hike
just what the doctor ordered
blow your own trumpet
tear-jerking
spine-tingling
has-been
page-turner
household name
the last thing i want
do justice to
head and shoulders above
bang head against wall
memory like a sieve
like father like son
if it's the last thing i do
not the sharpest tool in the shed
a trip to the sun
touch off
eat like a horse
time flies
in the cross hairs
pay the piper
rub the wrong way
you can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs
forbidden fruit is always the sweetest
out of sight, out of mind
ignorance is bliss
if you scratch my back, i'll scratch yours
no news is good news
tip of the iceberg
hands are tied
money doesn't grow on trees
learn to walk before you run
if it ain't broke, don't fix it
still waters run deep
first things first
it's better to be safe than sorry
look before you leap
where there's a will, there's a way
many hands make light work
strike while the iron is hot
too many cooks spoil the broth
absence makes the heart grow fonder
honesty is the best policy
grass is always greener on the other side
two heads are better than one
familiarity breeds contempt
there's no time like the present
all good things must come to an end
beggars can't be choosers
a watched pot never boils
god helps those who help themselves
never look a gift horse in the mouth
the early bird catches the worm
discretion is the greater part of valour
there's no place like home
there's no such thing as a free lunch
birds of a feather flock together
keep your friends close and your enemies closer
hope for the best, but prepare for the worst
fortune favours the bold
follow by
no man is an island
run for cover
when the going gets tough, the tough get going
the squeaky wheel gets the grease
the pen is mightier than the sword
when in rome, do as the romans
food for thought
status quo
cold hearted
breakout
outbreak
being in love
a cut above
in the meantime
turning point
batten down the hatches
old habits die hard
stack the deck
beef up
learn the ropes
from time to time
two wrongs don't make a right
come down with
run a tight ship
heads up
get under skin
pass the torch
dream come true
a needle in a haystack
black and blue
twist of fate
lost in thought
faint of heart
fall between the cracks
black out
blow mind
pull your socks up
love me, love my dog
dead as a dodo
strive to do
none of your lip
take effect
time and again
back to the wall
within earshot
concern with
comb through
chill to the bone
keep on top
zoom away | zoom off
out of mind
suited and booted
prick up ears
pipe down
a house of cards
pull the plug
practice makes perfect

it's anyone's call
in your face
in the buff
every nook and cranny
in the bag
idle hands are the devil's tools
icing on the cake
going to hell in a handbasket
lose head
haste makes waste
gut feeling
great minds think alike
good samaritan
go out on a limb
go for broke
go down like a lead balloon
give the slip
get over it
get down to brass tacks
rags to riches
foam at the mouth
flip the bird
flash in the pan
field day
everything but the kitchen sink
drop like flies
down to the wire
don't look a gift horse in the mouth
curiosity killed the cat

close, but no cigar
chow down

end of story
joined at the hip
dog days

sealed with a kiss
no love lost
love to death
the course of true love never did run smooth
one cannot love and be wise
all is fair in love and war

labour of love
match made in heaven

double date
those three little words
walk out on
leave at the altar
break up | split up
